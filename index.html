<h1>Blackstone Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="juicy burgers on a cutting board" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="baked fish with potatoes and cherry tomatoes" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg"  width="200" height="200"></a><br>
These chicken are so good to eat that they just walk into our very hot torturous deep fryer, our chef will put together a bunch of great food together(that's the chicken fault not me).

<h2>Our Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg"  width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Fries from the heartland of french or another word for them here in the good old U.S.A, "French Fries" which are just regular fries.

<h2>Our Tabouleh?</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg"  width="200" height="200"></a><br>
This is so very good to eat that not even the person who is writting this now has no clue or what kind of food this really is to him or where it come from, or what it taste like but i sure you, our chef know what they are doing to fill you belly with the good stuff..
